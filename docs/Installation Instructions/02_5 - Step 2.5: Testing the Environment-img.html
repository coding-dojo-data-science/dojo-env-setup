  Step 2.5: Testing the Environment
 </h1>
 <p>
  To test that your installation and packages are working properly. We are going to run a specific Environment Testing notebook that is also located in the "dojo-env-setup" folder.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Running the environment tester notebook with jupyter notebook
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Next, you will close all of your previous Terminal/GitBash windows BUT before you do:
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     if your terminal is still running jupyter notebook and you do not see the prompt waiting for a command:
     <ul>
      <li>
       You must press "Control +C" to force-quit jupyter.
      </li>
      <li>
       Make sure to reply "y" if asked for confirmation.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     If the cursor appears waiting for a new command, you are all set.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Now, return to GitHub desktop and click on the "Open in Terminal/GitBash" to open a terminal in the dojo-env-setup folder.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Type pwd to confirm it says dojo-env-setup.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Note: if you do not see the button for Open in Terminal:
    </strong>
   </li>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Click on the menu for "Repository" at the very top of the window (if using Windows) or at the very top of your screen on your menu bar (if using a Mac).
    </li>
    <li>
     You should see the word "Repository" next to the FIle, Edit, View menus.
    </li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      From the Repository menu: click on Open in Terminal/GitBash
     </li>
    </ul>
   </ul>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    In the new window that opens, start jupyter notebook by entering the
    <code>
     jupyter notebook
    </code>
    command in your terminal (or the "jnb" shortcut!)
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A new tab should open in your web browser that shows the File view for jupyter notebook.
    </li>
    <li>
     You should see all of the files that were in the dojo-env-folder.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>

 <ul>
  <li>
   There are 2 "EnvironmentTester" notebooks:
   <ul>
    <li>
     "EnvironmentTester-mac.ipynb" for macs (both Intel and Apple Chip macs)
    </li>
    <li>
     "EnvironmentTester-windows.ipynb" for Windows.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Click on the test notebook for your OS to open it.
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Once the notebook interface has loaded, you should see a toolbar with several menu choices.
    </li>
   </ul>

 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We want to run all of the cells in this notebook and confirm it can make it to the end without errors.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    To Run the Entire Notebook:
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Select the "Kernel" Menu &gt; "Restart and Run All"
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Wait patiently.
     </strong>
     The testing notebook is going to run through several modeling and EDA steps to confirm that the packages are working correctly.
     <ul>
      <li>
       This could take anywhere from 2-10 minutes to run.
      </li>
      <li>
       You will see the web browser tab icon turn to an hourglass when the notebook is running and back to an orange notebook icon when it is done.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Scroll down to the bottom of the notebook and confirm the cells have run:
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Check if the very last cell printed the success message.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
