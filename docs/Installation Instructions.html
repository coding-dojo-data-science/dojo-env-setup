<html><body><h1>Installing Python Locally</h1><br><hr></hr><br><h1>Installation Overview</h1>
<p><strong>In Stack 4: Data Enrichment, you will use new tools on your computer that will require a local installation
		of Python</strong> instead of Google Colab. Please complete these installation steps <strong>by the beginning of
		Stack 4.<br></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>These steps should take ~30-90 minutes,</strong> depending on the speed of your machine and internet
	connection. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup" target="_blank">dojo-env-setup
		repository</a>, which you will clone in Step 2.1, contains a backup copy of the entire set of instructions on
	the README, for convenience.</p>
<blockquote>Note: if you previously installed the dojo-env before July 7th, 2022 and are upgrading to the new one,
	please see the "Updating to New dojo-env" at the end of this chapter (after the Final Notes lesson)<br></blockquote>
<p><strong>By the end of this chapter, you will:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li> Install GitHub Desktop,</li>
	<li> Install Python via Anaconda (or via miniforge - if on a Mac with an Apple Chip)</li>
	<li> Create a special Python environment (dojo-env)</li>
	<li>Supercharge Jupyter Notebooks with Extensions</li>
	<li> Install Visual Studio Code. </li>
</ol>
<h2>If you encounter an error during installation: </h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>First, read a little further down in the instructions to make sure we do not already address</strong>
		the error message that you ran into.</li>
	<li>Second, <strong>please check the "Troubleshooting" chapter</strong> for a lesson about the problem you are
		running into.<br>(The Troubleshooting section is the 3rd chapter in this course - see the screenshot below)<br>

	</li>
	<li>Third, reach out on the #ds-python-installation Discord channel (<a
			href="https://discord.com/channels/738494436467539968/999108307627294770" target="_blank">Link</a>) with:
		<ul>
			<li> What step you are on (e.g. Step 2.3 Creating the dojo-env)
			</li>
			<li>What OS you are using (e.g. Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac with an Apple Processor, etc)
			</li>
			<li>Screenshots of the error/issue you are running into, whenever possible.</li>
			<li>Finally, if you have been able to run the test notebook in Step 2.4: Testing the Env, please upload

</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>OS-Specific Steps/Commands</h2>
<p><strong>For several steps (e.g. Step 1), there are multiple versions of the instructions, depending on what operating
		system you are using.</strong></p>
<p> (i.e. a Windows computer, vs a Mac with an Intel processor, vs a Mac with an Apple Chip (m1/m1pro/m2/etc).)</p>
<p><dfn>For step 1, please make sure you are on the correct instruction page for your OS. </dfn></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Regardless of OS, you will be using tools that serve the following purposes:<br></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Your "Terminal"/"Shell": <ul>
			<li>The primary application you will use to execute coding-related commands.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A Python Distribution:<ul>
			<li>The fundamental infrastructure for installing Python.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>GitHub Desktop:<ul>
			<li>App for working with and managing git repositories. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Our custom Python Environment (dojo-env)<ul>
			<li>A bundle of packages required for stacks 1-5+</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Jupyter Notebooks / Jupyter Lab <ul>
			<li>The primary editor we will use (instead of Colab).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Visual Studio Code<ul>
			<li>A special text editor designed for code. It has many extensions and languages available. </li>
			<li>We will use it to edit special files, but it can also run notebooks too!</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preface: Good News and Bad News</h2>
<ul>
	<li>So...you got one of those shiny new(ish) Mac computers with Apple chip, eh? We've got some good news and bad
		news for you. <ul>
			<li>The good news:<ul>
					<li> Your python code will run blisteringly fast compared to a Mac with an Intel chip! </li>
					<li>Code that may take hours elsewhere will only take minutes for your computer. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The bad news:<ul>
					<li>Your instructions for Tool #3 below (the Python Distribution) are going to be very different
						than the other operating systems. </li>
					<li>Additionally, there are still packages that have not yet been updated to be compatible with your
						processor. <ul>
							<li>But don't worry: everything that is in the other OS's dojo-env is also in yours!
								<br>Just a heads up if you go to install a new package and run into issues.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h1>STEP # 1 INSTRUCTIONS:</h1>
<p>Note: steps for Tools # 1 and 2 are the same for Mac users with an Intel processor. </p>
<h2>Tool #1: A Linux-based bash shell/terminal:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Linux users and MacOS users have this built-in to their OS.<ul>
			<li>On MacOS, the shell is called "Terminal" and can be found in <code>Applications&gt;Utilities</code> in
				Finder</li>
			<li>OR you can use spotlight search and search for "Terminal".</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tool #2: GitHub Desktop</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Download the installer from this link: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>
	</li>
	<li>Once installation is complete, open the application.<ul>
			<li>Log into the same GitHub account you have been using for your projects.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Once you have logged into the app, open the Options menu<ul>
			<li> Select <code>"GitHub Desktop"</code> on the menu bar (top of the screen) and then select
				<code>Preferences</code>.</li>
			<li>Select the "Integrations" tab.</li>
			<li>Make sure the Shell dropdown menu says GitBash<ul>
					<li>If not, select it from the dropdown menu.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Click Save.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Note: Here is where the instructions for Apple Chips will significantly deviate from the
		others.<br></strong></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>primary difference</strong> is that in order for us to use Apple-Chip compatible versions of
		packages (like TensorFlow), <strong>we CAN NOT use the standard Anaconda distribution. </strong></li>
	<li>There is a l<strong>ightweight alternative to Anaconda, called miniforge</strong>, that will install much of the
		<strong>same foundations as Anaconda,</strong> but with access to alternative versions of packages that are
		optimized for Apple Chips.<ul>
			<li><strong>Note/Warning: you would still be <em>able</em></strong><strong> to install Anaconda if you
					tried, but</strong> your computer will <strong>never</strong> be able to run TensorFlow if you use
				Anaconda. So please, take our word for it that it is worth following our alternative instructions </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The following instructions are based on <a
			href="https://caffeinedev.medium.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-m1-mac-8e9b91d93706" target="_blank">this
			blog post</a>, should you wish to review it in-depth.<span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pre-Tool #3 Verification:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>VERIFY THAT ANACONDA IS NOT ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER.<ul>
			<li><strong>Open a terminal window and run the "conda" command</strong> (without quotation marks). <ul>
					<li><strong>If it says conda not found, great!</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>You're ready to install miniforge. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>If it shows a list of available conda command</strong>s:<ul>
							<li><strong>You MUST FOLLOW THE APPENDIX INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS LESSON FOR
									"Uninstalling Anaconda".</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>CRITICAL NOTE: <ul>
			<li><strong>IF YOUR TERMINAL RECOGNIZED THE CONDA COMMAND ANACONDA MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE INSTALLING
					MINIFORGE. </strong></li>
			<li>Failure to heed this warning will break all of your python environments and it is NOT easy to fix!!!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Tool #3: Python Distribution - miniforge</h2>
<p>Tool # 3 will involve several steps with several verification steps along the way. Make sure to follow each Step and
	Verification step below to ensure you have a problem-free python installation.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Install XCode (a Mac-specific developer toolkit from Apple)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Run the command below in your Terminal.<ul>
			<li>Note: this step may take several minutes </li>
			<li>You may be asked to enter your password to approve the installation. This is your normal user password
				to log into your computer.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<pre data-language="ruby">xcode-select --install</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Install Homebrew ( a database of downloadable apps/tools for Mac)</h3>
<p>Visit <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">https://brew.sh/</a> for more information about Homebrew</p>
<ul>
	<li>To Install homebrew, run the following command in your Terminal (and make sure to read the steps below):</li>
</ul>
<pre
	data-language="ruby">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>You may be asked to enter your password in your terminal.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>This is the same password you use to log into your mac. </li>
			<li>Enter your password when prompted and hit Enter. <ul>
					<li>NOTE: You will not be able to see what keys you have typed, so just trust that it is recognizing
						your keystrokes and hit enter. It will notify you if the password was incorrect.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The installation process will pause and ask you "Press RETURN to continue or any other key to
			abort".</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>When it does, press Return/Enter!</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Step 2B: CRITICAL NOTE</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>When homebrew has finished installing, it may display a message telling you to run 1 or 2 commands in
				your Terminal. <ul>
					<li><strong>It is very important that you run those commands</strong>, otherwise, your terminal will
						not know that homebrew has been installed.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2 Verification:</h3>
<p>Confirm that homebrew was successfully installed:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong> Open a New Terminal Window (shortcut: Cmd+N or Cmd+T) and run the "brew" command</strong>. <ul>
			<li>If it lists available commands, great!<ul>
					<li> You're all set to move forward.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>If it says brew not found, </strong>
				<ul>
					<li>You may have missed the commands to paste at the end of the homebrew installation.</li>
					<li>Try installing homebrew again and make sure to pay attention to the final text that's displayed
						and follow any additional instructions it displays.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Install miniforge using homebrew.</h2>
<br>
<h3>Step 3 Commands:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Enter the brew installation command below in your terminal:</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<pre data-language="ruby">brew install miniforge</pre>
	<ul>
		<li>Once miniforge has finished installing, run the following command in your terminal (required for
			Matplotlib):</li>
	</ul>
	<pre data-language="ruby">brew install pkg-config</pre>
	<h3>Post-Step 3 Verification</h3>
</div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open a new terminal window and enter the "conda" command.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>If it lists available commands, fantastic!! <ul>
					<li><strong>You are all set to move on to the next page of instructions "2. Setting Up Your dojo-env
							Environment"!!</strong></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If it says conda not found, try restarting your computer and then try running the conda command again.
				<ul>
					<li>If it still says conda not found, reach out to your instructor or a TA for help ASAP.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<h2>APPENDIX: UNINSTALLING ANACONDA</h2>
<p>If your computer already knew the conda command during "Pre-Step 3 Verification", it is critical that you remove
	anaconda before continuing with the miniforge installation.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Uninstallation Verification Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with another User who also uses Python:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Pause here and check with them BEFORE you uninstall anaconda. <strong>You will be removing all of their
					python environments too,</strong> even though they have a separate User account.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with someone and they have concerns about uninstalling anaconda: </strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stop here (for now)</strong>.<ul>
					<li>Do not move forward with the instructions until you have spoken with your instructor. </li>
					<li>Your instructor may be able to address concerns that your fellow User has and convince them to
						let you install miniforge. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Alternatively, you could follow the Step 1 - MacOS (Intel Processor) instructions instead but:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Your python code will run slower than it would with miniforge.</li>
			<li>You will not be able to import tensorflow without your kernel crashing.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Your instructor may be able to address concerns that your fellow User has and convince them to let you install
		miniforge. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Official Steps for Fully Uninstalling Anaconda:</h4>
<p>The following steps are taken directly from the <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/"
		target="_blank">Official Uninstalling Anaconda documentation page</a>, specifically "Option B. Full uninstall
	using Anaconda-Clean and simple remove."</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Install the Anaconda-Clean package from Anaconda Prompt (terminal on Linux or macOS):</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby">conda install anaconda-clean</pre>
<ul>
	<li>In the same window, run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby">anaconda-clean --yes</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Once the process has been completed, manually delete any "anaconda3" or "anaconda2" folders that still exist.
		<ul>
			<li>It may be located in one of several possible folders. Run the following "ls -a" commands until you see a
				folder called "anconda2" or "anaconda3". </li>
			<li><strong>Once you see an anaconda folder, take note of:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong> Which command showed the folder.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong> Specifically, what did the command say after "ls -a" </strong></li>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "base folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>If the anaconda folder was "anconda2" or "anaconda3"</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "anaconda folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>and j</strong>ump to the very last command at the bottom of the page, with those 2 pieces of
				information.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby">ls -a ~/
ls -a ~/opt/
ls -a /opt/</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Run the final command to remove the anaconda folder once you've identified your "base folder" and "anaconda
		folder".<ul>
			<li>Replace {base_folder} with the actual folder name</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Replace {anaconda_folder} with the actual folder name.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby">rm -rf {base_folder}{anaconda_folder}
</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once you've replaced the placeholder folder names with your actual folder names, the command should look something
	like this:</p>
<pre data-language="ruby">rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3
# or 
rm -rf ~/anaconda2
# or 
rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3</pre>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Final Verification Step:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Now, open a new terminal window and try running the "conda" command again. Your terminal should say that
			conda is not found.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>If it says conda is not found, you are now ready to jump back up to the "Step 3
					Commands"</strong> header above.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>If your computer still displays a list of conda commands</strong>: please see the final portion
				of the <a
					href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/#removing-anaconda-path-from-bash-profile"
					target="_blank">Official Uninstallation Instructions "Removing Anaconda from .bash_profile"</a>,
				which is illustrated below:</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open the two settings file for your terminal and remove anything related to anaconda:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1) Run the "open ~/.bash_profile" (without quotation marks) command and a text editor window
					should open.</strong>
				<ul>
					<li> Examine the contents of this file and <strong>delete any lines that look like either of the
							screenshots below</strong>:<ul>
							<li><br><img
									src="../images/lp/conda_init_code.png">
							</li>
							<li><img
									src="../images/lp/Screen_Shot_2022-08-05_at_6.55.05_PM.png">
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>2) <strong>Now repeat the process, but use the "open ~/.zshrc"</strong> (without quotation marks)
				command<ul>
					<li>Delete any lines of code that look like the screenshots above.</li>
					<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>FInal Verification:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Open a New Terminal Window (the changes you made above only take effect when opening a new window)</li>
			<li>Run the "conda" command again and you should now see a message that says "conda not found"<ul>
					<li>If you are still seeing the list of conda commands instead, re-open the two files listed above
						and make sure you saved them after deleting the lines of code. </li>
					<li>Close your terminal window and open a new one and try the "conda" command again.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If the conda command still displays the list of commands after the steps above:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Try restarting your computer </strong>and attempting to run the command one more time.</li>
			<li><strong>If you are still seeing conda commands:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>You should post your problem on the <a

<p><br></p><br><hr></hr><br><h1>Step 1 - Windows</h1>
<h3>Tool #1: A Linux-based bash shell/terminal:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Windows users should install GitBash</strong>, instead of using the windows command prompt<ul>
			<li>Otherwise, all of the commands for working with your terminal will not match the curriculum and other
				cloud-based platforms (like Amazon Web Services).<ul>
					<li>Note: for a list of the equivalent commands for Windows command prompt see <a
							href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/" target="_blank">this cheat
							sheet</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Download the Git for Windows Installer: <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows
					download</a>
				<ul>
					<li>Select the default options.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tool #2: GitHub Desktop</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Download the installer from this link: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>
	</li>
	<li>Once installation is complete, open the application.<ul>
			<li>Log into the same GitHub account you have been using for your projects.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Once you have logged into the app, open the Options menu<ul>
			<li> Click on <code>File</code> in the menu bar and then select <code>Options</code> </li>
			<li>Select the "Integrations" tab.</li>
			<li>Make sure the Shell dropdown menu says GitBash<ul>
					<li>If not, select it from the dropdown menu.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Click Save.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tool #3: Python Distribution - Anaconda </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Anaconda is a data-science-focused python distributable that comes with a convenient GUI program for working
		with our python environments. </li>
	<li>Download and run the installer from the following link: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual"
			target="_blank">Anaconda Individual Edition</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the default options, <strong>EXCEPT when you see the "Advanced Installation Options"</strong> window
				(like in the screenshot below).</li>
			<li>Select "Add Anaconda3 to my Path environment variable". Disregard the warning message will appear in red
				text.<ul>

<h2>Open the Repo in Terminal (mac) or GitBash (windows)</h2>
<p>Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to open a terminal/gitbash window in the same folder as the
	repository.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open a new terminal in the dojo-env-setup folder</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>First, in GitHub Desktop: make sure the left sidebar says "dojo-env-setup" in the top-left corner under
				Current Repository.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Click on the Repository menu and select "<code>Open in terminal</code>" or
					"<code>Open in gitbash</code>"</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows Users: the menu will be at the top of GitHub Desktop's window.</li>
					<li>Mac Users: the menu will appear at the very top of your screen (your menu bar).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing. The command for both Mac
					and Windows is:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Control + `</strong> (the key above tab that also has the tilde symbol ~)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>In the terminal window that appears, type the "pwd" command (stands for print working directory)
			and press Enter.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>It will display the folder name of the folder your terminal is currently located. <ul>
					<li>The folder path should end in "dojo-env-setup/"</li>
					<li>If you used the default GitHub folder when you cloned dojo-env, the full filepath would be
						something similar to "/Users/yourname/Documents/GitHub/dojo-env-setup/"</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Troubleshooting (Windows): </h3>
<div>
	<p>If you are having trouble getting GitHub desktop to open GitBash in the correct folder there are 2 solutions for
		getting your gitbash window in the dojo-env-setup folder.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<font color="#505050" face="Gotham-Rounded-Medium"><strong>Solution #1: Using File Explorer +
					Right Click</strong></font>
			<ul>
				<li>If you followed the instructions in step 1 and used the default options when installing Git for
					Windows/GitBash, you should have a new option in your Right-Click menu that says "GitBash here".
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>In GitHub Desktop <strong>click the Repository menu again and select "Show in File
						Explorer".</strong></li>
				<li>Once file explorer opens,<strong> right-click anywhere inside the folder </strong>(right-click on
					empty space, not on a file) <strong>and select GitBash here</strong>.<ul>
						<li>A GitBash window should open in the correct folder.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Type pwd to confirm that you are indeed in the dojo-env-setup folder.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Solution #2: Open a new GitBash and navigate to the right folder.</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>If you do not have the option to "GitBash here", you can manually navigate there in GitBash.</li>
				<li><strong>Open the windows start menu, find and click on GitBash to open a new window.<br></strong>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Important Note: You must know the full file path for the repo for the next step. We will
						refer to as &lt;repo_filepath&gt; in the instructions below.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong> if you used the suggested default folder </strong>when cloning the repo, your
							repo_filepath should be: <ul>
								<li>" /Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Documents/GitHub/dojo-env-setup" <ul>
										<li>But instead of &lt;your name&gt; it will be your actual user name for
											your computer</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>If you are not sure what your username is, run the "whoami" command in your
											GitBash to see your user name.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>If you did NOT use the suggested default folder, </strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Your repo_filepath will be the path displayed in the window that appeared when you
									cloned the repo.<ul>
										<li>You should have taken note of the file path you selected, as indicated in
											the screenshot.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Once you know what your repo_filepath is navigate to that folder using the change directory
					command (cd)<ul>
						<li>"cd &lt;repo_filepath&gt;".</li>
						<li>See the examples below:</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">## Examples are assuming your username is "codingdojo"
# Example if you used default folder:
cd /Users/codingdojo/Documents/GitHub/dojo-env-setup/
# Example if you used a different folder. e.g. you made a Boot Camp Stuff folder in your Documents folder.
cd /Users/codingdojo/Documents/Boot Camp Stuff/</pre>
	<p><br></p>
	<h3></h3>
	<h2>Verify Step 2.2</h2>
	<p>Run one last command to verify that you are indeed in the correct folder. </p>
	<p>Run the "ls -a" command to see a detailed list of all files in the repo.</p>
	<pre>ls -a</pre>
	<p>You should see a list of all the files in the current folder. </p>
	<p><br></p>
	<p><strong>If you are in the right folder, you should see 3 files that start with "environment" and end with ".yml"

<h1>1) Commands For Mac OS </h1>
<ul>
	<li>All mac users should follow these instructions (regardless of if your have an Intel or Apple processor).</li>
	<li>On a Mac, we need to first see what shell terminal is using. <ul>

<h2>Determining If your Shell is Bash or Zsh</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In your terminal, type <code>echo $SHELL</code> and hit enter.</li>

<ul>
	<li>You've already run this command before, but if you don't remember which command you ran:<ul>
			<li><strong>Run the "conda activate base" or "conda activate dojo-env" command in gitbash.</strong>
				<ul>

<h2>Step 2 Overview:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In Step 1, we installed the foundational tools needed for our local python installation. </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>While we did install a Python distribution with a basic copy of Python (Anaconda or miniforge), we have
                not installed all of the packages and tools that we need as data scientists.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In Step 2, you will be creating a custom python environment called "dojo-env". </strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>An "environment" is a bundle of specific python packages that are used together.</strong>
                Importantly, an environment specifies specific version #'s of the packages to ensure that all of the
                versions installed are mutually compatible.</li>
            <li><strong>You can install many environments</strong> on your computer and switch between them as needed
                for different projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We have designed the dojo-env to include everything you'd need for our program</strong>, so you
                may not have a reason to add additional environments. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Currently Supported Operating Systems</h3>
<h3></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>We have prepared environment files (.yml files) for 3 different OS configurations:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows (10 &amp; 11)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mac (with Intel processors)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mac (Apple Chips). <br></strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Reminder for mac users: <ul>
            <li>Please revisit the "1. Downloading and Installing Apps" lesson if you are not sure which type of mac you
                are using.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Note to Linux Users:<ul>
            <li>Sorry Linux users! A Linux machine was not available for testing during the development of the dojo-env.
            </li>
            <li>If you are willing to work with an instructor to develop and test a Linux version of dojo-env, contact
                your instructor or send an email to jirving@codingdojo.com requesting assistance in create a linux
                version of dojo-env.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The environment files (and a backup of these instructions) are in the dojo-env-setup repository</strong>
        (<a

    <li>Step 2.1: Clone the dojo-env-setup repository</li>
    <li>Step 2.2: Open the repo in your terminal/GitBash</li>
    <li>Step 2.3: Create the dojo-env environment</li>
    <li>Step 2.4: Setting dojo-env as your default.</li>
</ul><br><hr></hr><br><h1>Step 3: Install a Code Text Editor </h1>
<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The final tool to install is a text editor that is designed for programmers.<ul>
			<li>There are several text editors available, but we will be using Visual Studio Code.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Visual Studio Code (A.K.A "VS Code") </strong>is a free editor that is highly customizable and supports
		many languages.<ul>
			<li>It is maintained by Microsoft and has a robust community of extensions and add-ons.</li>
			<li>It is very popular and is used by many companies (e.g. Facebook/Meta)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>How will we use VS Code?</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<font color="#505050" face="Gotham-Rounded-Medium"><strong>We could technically run all of our jupyter
						notebooks using VS Code, but this is not recommended </strong>at this point in your education
				</font>. <ul>
					<li>While VS Code is convenient for quickly opening and working with a repository or viewing a
						notebook, it has some limitations in how notebooks look and some quirks to the interface for
						notebooks.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Instead, we will focus on using<strong> jupyter notebook or jupyter lab in the lessons and live
							class.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>You are welcome to try VS Code for notebooks, but it is recommended you become
								comfortable with jupyter first.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>We will use VS Code for editing simple code files or hidden files.</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>We can open and edit the settings file for your terminal (e.g.: "<code>~/.bash_profile"</code>.or
				"~/.zshrc"</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>We will use it to create and store credentials for APIs (Stack 4)</li>
			<li>We can use VS Code to edit your projects' README files while previewing them in real time!</li>
			<li>Finally, while beyond the scope of the standard curriculum, we can also use VS Code to store functions
				in external files that we can use just like pandas, matplotlib,</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul></ul>
<h2>Install Visual Studio Code</h2>
<ul>
	<li>

				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Note: the Python extension will also install several required extensions. When installation is complete, you
			should see the following under the "INSTALLED" section:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Python, Pylance, Jupyter Notebook renderer, Jupyter, and Jupyter Keymap</li>
		</ul>

<h2>Setting VS Code to use your <code>dojo-env</code> as the default Python installation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>We must teach the Python extension where to find our <code>dojo-env</code>'s version of Python.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>On the extension sidebar, click on the Gear icon for the Python extension and select "Extension Settings"

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You should see a new "Settings" pane open in the main window.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Take note of the "Default Interpreter Path".
				<ul>
					<li>It is currently set to just "python".<br>

					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>We need to change this setting to match the exact filepath for our <code>dojo-env</code>'s python.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In your terminal or GitBash:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure your dojo-env is activated</li>
			<li>Run the command: <code>which python</code>
				<ul>
					<li>It will print out a filepath to your dojo-env.<br>

<h3>Mac Users Only: Add the <code>code</code> command to your terminal</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We want to be able to type the word "code" in our terminal and have that open up VS Code.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Windows users have this command added automatically during installation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Mac Users must run 1 more command from VS Code.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Open the Command Palette:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Either click on View in the menu bar and select "Command Palette"</li>
			<li>OR use the keyboard shortcut (<code>Cmd</code> + <code>Shift</code> +<code>p</code>)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In the small pop-up window, type "install code" and you should see it auto-suggest the option for "Shell
			Command: Install 'code' command in PATH".</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click on this option.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Test the <code>code</code> command</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Open a new terminal or GitBash window.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Run the command <code>code</code> to verify that VS Code opens.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Note: You can add a specific folder or filename to open, after the word code.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To open the current folder <code>code .</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If it opens, great!</p>
		<ul>

<h4>IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MAC USERS WITH AN APPLE CHIP (M1, M1Pro, M2, etc)!</h4>
<p>The original v1 of dojo-env did not fully support Apple processors, but the new dojo-env does. HOWEVER, in order to
	do so, <strong>Mac users with an Apple chip need to UNINSTALL ANACONDA and switch to using Miniforge</strong>. </p>
<p><dfn style="color: rgb(192, 80, 77);"><strong>Please see "Step 1 - MacOS (Apple Chip)" and scroll to the bottom for
			the UNINSTALLING ANACONDA instructions.<br> </strong>IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU DO THIS OR IT MAY PERMANENTLY
		BREAK YOUR ENVIRONMENT!</dfn></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><strong>NOTE: there is an abbreviated summary of commands for this process at the bottom of this page for
		convenience.</strong></blockquote>
<h2>Step 1: Remove Your Old dojo-env</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<ol>
			<li>Open your terminal/GitBash</li>
			<li>Deactivate<code>dojo-env</code>: <ol>
					<li>Type <code>conda activate base</code> (or source activate base if you are on older versions of
						windows) <ol>
							<li>Your terminal should now say <code>(base)</code> next to your prompt instead of
								<code>(dojo-env)</code>.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Remove the old <code>dojo-env</code> using the command:</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">conda remove --name dojo-env --all
</pre>
<p> Enter <code>y</code> to approve the removal of the environment and hit enter.<br></p>
<p> 4. Wait for the env to be removed.</p>
<p> This will delete all of the files associated with JUST our <code>dojo-env</code>. </p>
<p> Anaconda &amp; GitBash will still be installed. We will just need to re-install our <code>dojo-env</code></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Step 2: Clone the updated dojo-env-setup repo </h2>
<ol>
	<li>To avoid merge conflicts when pulling the updated repository, <strong>you should remove your old clone of the
			dojo-env-setup repo </strong>and then clone it again.<ol>
			<li>In GitHubDesktop, switch to the dojo-env-setup repository in the Current Repo drop down menu (top left).
				Once you're in dojo-env-setup, click on the "Repository" menu and select "Remove" &gt; check Move to
				Trash/Recycle Bin.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Navigate to the dojo-env-setup repo: <a href="https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup"
			target="_blank">https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup</a></li>
	<li><strong>Clone the Repository to Your Computer:</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>Click the green Code button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop. "</li>
			<li>If you still have your previously cloned copy, GitHub Desktop should show a # and down arrow on the top
				right corner where it should say "Fetch Origin".<ol>
					<li>Press the button to "Fetch Origin", which will download the updated environment files. </li>
					<li>You may need to press it again if it changes to "Pull Origin"</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>If you've updated the repo successfully there should be no remaining #'s or arrows on the top right
				corner.<ol>
					<li>If so, click on the Repository menu &gt; Open in Terminal (or Open in GitBash).</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Step 3: (Re)Create Your dojo-env using the updated repo</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Run the same commands from the original step "2. Setting Up Your <code>dojo-env</code> Environment" (summarized
		below).<ol>
			<li>If you are unsure about which version of the summary instructions below to use, please go to the
				original Step 2 lesson for your specific OS and follow those steps again. </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>"Step 2: Setting Up Your Dojo-Env" Summary:</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>Depending on your OS and processor, you will use a different environment file in the conda env create
				command. <ol>
					<li>In the table below find the environment yml file name that is correct for your computer/OS.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Whenever the instructions below refer to your &lt;ENV_FILE&gt; below, it means the filename from the following
	list (without &lt; &gt;).</p>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Computer/OS Type</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Environment File Name</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Windows </td>
			<td>environment_windows.yml</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MacOS with an Intel Processor</td>
			<td>environment_mac_intel.yml</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MacOS with an Apple Chip (m1, m1pro, m2,etc)</td>
			<td>environment_mac_mchip.yml</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you are still using a terminal inside the folder for the dojo-env-setup (pwd)</li>
	<li>Run the following command (replace &lt;ENV_FILE&gt; with your filename from the table above)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">conda env create -f &lt;env_file&gt;
## Env Creation Commands by OS
# Windows 
conda env create -f environment_windows.yml
# Mac - Intel Processor 
conda env create -f environment_mac_intel.yml
# Mac - Apple Chip 
conda env create -f environment_mac_mchip.yml</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wait (patiently) for the dojo-env to be created. </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Note: the new environment includes many additional tools and can take anywhere from 3-20 minutes to
				finish downloading and installing the packages for the new environment.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Once its complete, run the following "conda activate dojo-env" command:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">conda activate dojo-env</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Note for Windows users:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li> if you see a message that says "your terminal is not set up for conda activate", change the command to
				"source activate"</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">source activate dojo-env</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>You should now see "(dojo-env)" next to your prompt in your terminal </strong>(may be above the prompt,
		on the left, or on the right depending on your OS)<br><img
			src="../images/lp/confirm_dojo_env.png"
			width="363" height="80" style="width: 363px; height: 80px;"></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>After confirming you now see (dojo-env) displayed next to your prompt:<ul>
			<li>Run the following command to make sure Jupyter Notebook/Lab knows your new environment.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">python -m ipykernel install --user --name dojo-env --display-name "Python (dojo-env)"
</pre>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Testing Your New Environment</h2>
<ul>
	<li>From the same terminal window, <strong>start jupyter notebook</strong> (run <code>jupyter notebook</code> in
		your terminal) </li>
	<li><strong>Open the test notebook for your OS (windows vs mac).</strong>
		<ul>
			<li> EnvironmentTester-Mac.ipynb or EnvironmentTester-Windows.ipynb </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Select the Kernel Menu &gt; Restart and Run All. </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The notebook should run all the way to the end.<ul>
					<li> If it doesn't, contact your instructor for assistance.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus: Jupyter Lab</h2>
<p>Your new dojo-env also includes jupyter lab. It is very similar to jupyter notebook, but has a more fleshed out user
	interface that is more similar to Colab than jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>To start jupyter lab run the following command:</p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">jupyter lab</pre>
